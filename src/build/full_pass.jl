"""
    full_pass(watched_files; kw...)

Perform a full pass over a set of watched files: each of these is then
processed in the `gc` context.

This can happen in the following situations (see `build_loop`)

1. the initial start of the server (GC is fresh)
2. if a layout HTML file was changed (e.g. '_layout/head.html')
3. if config.md changed
4. if utils.jl changed

In the last case, the GC is reinstantiated so that all children contexts get
re-instantiated from scratch, reloading Utils at the start. This is important
since any code cell might call from Utils and we don't know which ones do.

## KW-Args

    gc:           global context in which to do the full pass
    skip_files:   list of file pairs to ignore in the pass
    layout_changed: whether this was triggered by a layout change
    config_changed: whether this was triggered by a config change
    utils_changed: whether this was triggered by a utils change

NOTE: it's not straightforward to parallelise this since pages can request
access to other pages' context or the global context menaing there's a fair
bit of interplay that's possible.
