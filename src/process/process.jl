    process_file(a...; kw...)

Take a file (markdown, html, ...) and process it appropriately:

* copy it "as is" in `__site`
* generate a derived file into `__site`

## Paths

    * md file
        -> process_md_file
         -> process_md_file_io!
          -> _process_md_file_html  < OR >  _process_md_file_latex

    * html file
        -> process_html_file
         -> process_html_file_io!

    * other file
        -> copy the file over
