    process_md_file_pass_1(...)

[threaded] Source MD to iHTML. Ignore layout and DBB.

* input     : read .md file
* output    : ihtml stored in lc var
* shortcut  : file hasn't changed and ihtml is available in lc

Side items:
- discovery of anchors that may have been removed since last version
- discovery of tags that have been removed/added since last version

(these will be processed separately as it needs direct access to GC objects
and so is not thread safe).

Return true/false if the file was skipped.
